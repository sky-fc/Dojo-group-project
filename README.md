***PROJECT DESCRIPTION***
<br/>Very similar to the the original 'Bright Ideas!' wire frame but instead focused on 
users being able to post image with a short text description as story prompts. 
Other users can like and / or reply to these posted prompts with a continuation of the story from the original post, 
or with their own story ideas based on it.
